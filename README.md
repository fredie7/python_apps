## A Diabetes Diagonistic App Implemented Using Decision Tree Classifier.


#### This made use of a collection of data obtained from the laboratory of Medical City Hospital  and the Specialist Center for Endocrinology and Diabetes-Al-Kindy Teaching Hospital,Iraq, spanning various column features


#### A tactful feature engineering was carried out before relevant columns were selected such as age,urea level,creatinine ratio,cholesterol level,low density lipoprotein and body mass index.


#### I visualized how Cholesterol impacted Low density lipoprotein in corresponding order of increasing ascendancy.


#### Ultimately, a function encapsulating the predictive system is put together for ease of reference.
